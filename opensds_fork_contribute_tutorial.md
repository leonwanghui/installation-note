Before making modifications of opensds project, you need to make sure that this project have been forked to your own

```
git checkout -b new_branch_name origin/devlopment
```

## Step 4: Push the code to the remote repository

After updating the code, you should push the update in the formal way:

git add .
git status (Check the update status)
git commit -m "Your commit title"
